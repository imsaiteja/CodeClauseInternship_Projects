Project 1:Object Detection System:
An Object Detection System is a computer vision project designed to identify and locate objects within digital images or video frames. It involves the use of algorithms and machine learning techniques to recognize and classify various objects in real-time or offline. The system typically consists of a pre-trained model that has learned patterns and features from a diverse set of images during its training phase
